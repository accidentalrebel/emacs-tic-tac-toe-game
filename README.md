# emacs-tic-tac-toe-game
Practice project for me to learn Emacs Lisp by making a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Based on the talk by Zachary Kanfer titled "Writing Games with Emacs" given at the New York Emacs Meetup. Video can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk39mp8Vy4M

I have taken the gist of the talk and is currently implementing what I learned using my own approach.
